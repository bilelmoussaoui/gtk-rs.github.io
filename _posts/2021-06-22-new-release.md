It's been a long time since the last release, and, as you can guess, a lot of things happened in
this span of time. Let's start with the most important one:

**gtk-rs now provides bindings for GTK4 libraries!**

They are all available in the [gtk4-rs](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs) repository.

We also wrote an introductory book to teach users how to use **gtk4-rs**. You can read it
[here](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/book/). A more detailed blog post about GTK4 will
follow in the next days.

## New website and new logo

We used this occasion to completely re-design the website and also make a logo. Since you're already
here, don't hesitate to go take a look around!

## GNOME Circle

**gtk-rs** is now part of the [GNOME Circle](https://circle.gnome.org/)! It allows our contributors
to join the GNOME foundation if they want to in addition to some other benefits. Check the website
for more details.

## Repositories changes

This release also saw changes to the gtk-rs repositories structure. We now have three main
repositories:

 * [gtk-rs-core][gtk-rs-core]: It contains crates which are considered "core" because they are used
   by both GTK3 and GTK4, but also by other projects such as [gstreamer-rs][gstreamer-rs]:
   * cairo
   * gdk-pixbuf
   * gio
   * glib
   * glib-macros
   * graphene
   * pango
   * pangocairo
 * [gtk3-rs][gtk3-rs]: Contains crates which are part of the GTK3 ecosystem:
   * atk
   * gdk
   * gdkx11
   * gtk3-macros
 * [gtk4-rs][gtk4-rs]: Contains crates which are part of the GTK4 ecosystem:
   * gdk4
   * gdk4-wayland
   * gdk4-x11
   * gsk4
   * gtk4
   * gtk4-macros

Another important point about this: all crates in one repository share the same version number now.
Before it was a bit of a mess so we decided to simplify it. So here are the version numbers for each
repository:

 * [gtk-rs-core][gtk-rs-core]: 0.14
 * [gtk3-rs][gtk3-rs]: 0.14
 * [gtk4-rs][gtk4-rs]: 0.1

## Documentation improvements

**gtk-rs** crates use the C documentation, however we improved its rendering a bit to make it even
more useful for Rust developers:

 * The items' links are now correctly generated.
 * If code examples are not written in Rust, we now add warnings to avoid confusion.
 * We added doc aliases, so you can now search signal names and even C function names directly.
 * Global functions, builder patterns, constants and statics are now documented as well.
 * Arguments which are C specific and therefore not used in the Rust bindings are not rendered anymore.

## Dependencies are re-exported

Instead of a long explanation, let's take an example. You have a GTK application and you also use
Cairo and GDK. Before this release, you would add all the 3 dependencies to your `Cargo.toml` file
to be able to use them. Now, you only need to import GTK and then you can do:

```rust
use gtk::{cairo, gdk};
```

And that's it! It'll make your management of dependencies much simpler. To be noted, they are also
in the `prelude`, so importing it will give you access to them:

```rust
use gtk::prelude::*;

// ...
let x = pango::something();
let y = gdk::something();
```

Last note about the re-exports: the `-sys` crates are also re-exported under the name `ffi`:

```rust
use gtk::ffi;

// You now have access to all raw C-functions of GTK.
```

## The `Value` trait was refactored

The main change is that for non-nullable types `Value::get()` will never ever return `None`,
replacing the previous confusing `Value::get_some()`.

In addition it is now possible to `Value::get()` a nullable type directly without `Option`
wrapping. If the value was actually `None` this would return an `Err`. In cases where the value
being `None` was unexpected this avoids one layer of unwrapping.

There is also a new generic `ValueType` trait that is implemented by all types that can be used
inside a `Value` and that allows storing/retrieving types of this value into/from a `Value`.

## Added GTK composite template support

For constructing widgets from a UI file, you can either use `gtk::Builder` or composite templates.
With the former, you have to keep an instance of `gtk::Builder` around. While with composite
templates, you make your custom widget (a subclass of `gtk::Widget`) use the template internally and
with the difference of being able to use your `CustomWidget` in a different UI file by defining:

```xml
<object class="CustomWidget">
  <property name="some-property">some-value</property>
</object>
```

You can now make your `CustomWidget` use the `#[CompositeTemplate]` derive macro. The work was done
initially for GTK4 Rust bindings, but was backported to GTK3 as well. See
[here](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/0.1/docs/gtk4_macros/derive.CompositeTemplate.html) or
[here](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs/tree/0.1/examples/composite_template) for examples.

Composite templates also allow you to use methods defined on your `CustomWidget` as a callback to a
signal directly from the UI file, even though the macro doesn't support that for now for both
GTK3/GTK4 bindings... But don't worry, [we're working on it](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk3-rs/issues/128)!

## New and improved macros

In addition to the `glib::object_subclass` attribute macro (see link to paragraph about subclassing
improvements), `glib` provides a couple of other macros now for making application development
easier and with less boilerplate:

 * [`glib::clone!`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.14/docs/glib/macro.clone.html): This macro allows automatic cloning or creation of weak references plus upgrading for closures and greatly simplifies creation of signal handler closures. The documentation contains a couple of examples. While this macro existed in the last release already, it was completely rewritten and made more powerful and got a companion `derive` macro [`glib::Downgrade`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.14/docs/glib_macros/derive.Downgrade.html) that extends custom types with the required machinery to be used for weak references in the context of the [`clone!`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.14/docs/glib/macro.clone.html) macro.
 * [`glib::GBoxed`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.14/docs/glib_macros/derive.GBoxed.html) and [`glib::GSharedBoxed`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.14/docs/glib_macros/derive.GSharedBoxed.html): These derive macros allow using custom Rust types inside [`glib::Value`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.14/docs/glib/value/struct.Value.html)s, which is required for example for GObject properties and signal parameters/return values or the content of GTK tree views. The first macro always clones the underlying value when necessary while the second makes use of reference counting instead of normal cloning.
 * [`glib::gflags!`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.14/docs/glib_macros/attr.gflags.html) and [`glib::GEnum`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.14/docs/glib_macros/derive.GEnum.html): These macros allow using Rust enums and [bitflags](https://docs.rs/bitflags) to be used inside [`glib::Value`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.14/docs/glib/value/struct.Value.html)s. See the [subclassing docs](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.14/docs/glib/subclass/index.html#example-for-registering-a-glibobject-subclass) for examples.
 * [`glib::GErrorDomain`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.14/docs/glib_macros/derive.GErrorDomain.html): This derive macro allows using a suitable Rust enum to be used as an error domain for [`glib::Error`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.14/docs/glib/error/struct.Error.html)s.

See also the [subclassing docs](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.14/docs/glib/subclass/index.html#example-for-registering-a-glibobject-subclass) for more examples about the [`glib::GBoxed`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.14/docs/glib_macros/derive.GBoxed.html), [`glib::gflags`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.14/docs/glib_macros/attr.gflags.html) and [`glib::GEnum`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.14/docs/glib_macros/derive.GEnum.html) macros.

## Improvements to subclassing

Implementing a GObject is simpler, thanks to the introduction of the [glib::object_subclass](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.14/docs/glib_macros/attr.object_subclass.html) `derive` macro. Additionally registering properties and signals now requires less boiler plate. Refer to [this page](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.14/docs/glib/subclass/index.html#example-for-registering-a-glibobject-subclass) for a complete example but a minimal example would look as follows now:

```rust
mod imp {
    #[derive(Default)]
    pub struct MyObject;

    #[glib::object_subclass]
    impl ObjectSubclass for MyObject {
        const NAME: &'static str = "MyObject";

        type Type = super::MyObject;
        type ParentType = glib::Object;
    }

    impl ObjectImpl for MyObject {}
}

glib::wrapper! {
    pub struct MyObject(ObjectSubclass<imp::MyObject>);
}

impl MyObject {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        glib::Object::new(&[]).unwrap()
    }
}
```

## Better cairo error handling

Using cairo is now more ergonomic: functions like [`fill()`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.14/docs/cairo/struct.Context.html#method.fill) or [`stroke()`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.14/docs/cairo/struct.Context.html#method.stroke) return a `Result` instead of requiring to manually check the [`Context::status()`](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk-rs-core/stable/0.14/docs/cairo/struct.Context.html#method.status). Additionally, all internal calls to `expect()` on the cairo status were removed, enabling the caller to handle error conditions, rather than causing a `panic`.

## Gir tutorial

**gtk-rs** crates are mostly generated automatically thanks to the [gir][gir] project. If you also
want to generate your own GObject-based crate bindings, you can use it as well! To help you, we
started a tutorial book that is available [here](https://gtk-rs.org/gir/book/).

## Naming improvements

We renamed a lot of functions/methods in order to make them more Rust-compliant. Specifically,
getter functions were renamed from `get_something()` to just `something()` or `is_something()`
while the setters stayed as `set_something()`. In addition GObject property getters/setters lost
their property designation from the name (i.e. `set_property_something()` was replaced by
`set_something()`).

On this note:

### Note to applications developers

Applications developers should use [`fix-getters-calls`](https://crates.io/crates/fix-getters-calls)
to ease migration of their applications. Use [`fix-getters-def`](https://crates.io/crates/fix-getters-def)
if you also want your get functions definition to comply with the API standards applied in this
release.
